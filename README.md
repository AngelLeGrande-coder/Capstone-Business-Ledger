# 🩸 Tokyo Ghoul Ledger — Java CLI Project

> “The more you try to erase me, the more I'll haunt you.” — Kaneki Ken

## 👁️ Overview

**Tokyo Ghoul Ledger** is a Java command-line application that reimagines a financial tracking system through the dark, stylish world of *Tokyo Ghoul*.  
Users can log deposits and payments, view categorized reports, and explore an interactive ledger filled with lore-based flavor text.

All transactions are stored in a CSV file (`transactions.csv`) — representing the “records of ghouls and investigators.”
